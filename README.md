# Spotify-Yt-Sync

This script scans spotify playlists and creates matchting youtube playlists.

Also it is able to keeps track of progress and will update the created playlists => remove items , TODO Change name

The core design of this skript is to use as little api resources as posible because of Google quota limitation, 
and it does not use the Spotify api at all. This greatly reduces setup time.

Setup:

Just add links for profiles or playlists to be converted in config.ini



Do not change the windowsize for chromedriver


For now, logininformation to spotify is not required, just leave config undefinded and everything should still work
