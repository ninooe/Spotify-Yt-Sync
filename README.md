# Spotify-Yt-Sync

This script scans spotify playlists and creates matching youtube playlists.

Also it is able to keeps track of progress and will update the created playlists => remove items

The core design of this skript is to use as little api resources as posible to get around of Google quota limitation.

Setup:
